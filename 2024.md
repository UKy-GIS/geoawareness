## Main Event: Be a Geographer

February 22, 8:30 amâ€“noon, outside [Whitehall](https://uky-gis.github.io/geoawareness/map/)

Are you curious about what geographers do? We will have a variety of activities, including a geocache and a map that you can place a physical map pin that represents your hometown.

Doughnuts and assorted swag will be provided.

## Activities

We have a few self-guided activities that you can do as a warm-up for our main event.

### Where y'all from?

We have a printed map of the world and Kentucky that you can place a physical map pin on that represents your hometown. This map may come to your classroom or you can find it at our main event.

<!-- (Instructors: [schedule a time to use the map](https://forms.gle/qkvtUQKXduynUKDu6) in your classroom.) -->

### Where y'all from? (Online version!)

So you can't visit the map in person. That's OK! We have an online version of the map that you can use to place a virtual map pin on that represents your hometown. [Click here to place your pin](https://outragegis.com/uky-geotag/).

<!-- ### After you've placed your pin...

Now what? Enter a raffle to win maps and other geography-related prizes! Complete this short form, [Wildcats Around the World](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeWNSxKXnTLIKiwCCwvlvoeW70sqDK2N_B3btzDoiKXHcZn_A/viewform), where you can share fun facts about the place your pin marks.  -->

### Geocache

We have a few virtual geocaches hidden on campus. Find one and tell us about it!

<!-- Find one and tell us what it is at our November 9 event to enter a raffle. Geocache raffle winners will be announced starting at 11:30am, so submit your answer in person before that time. -->

[Click here to start geocache](https://outragegis.com/uky-geocache/).

<!-- Note: this geocache is not a physical geocache. It is a virtual geocache that you can find with your mobile device. Make sure your browser has permission to use your location. This application will store user locations in a database for educational purposes, but no personally identifiable information is collected. Come to our main event and view a real-time map of geocache participant locations.

### Raffles

We will have topographic maps for popular hiking destinations in Kentucky to give away. Raffles start at 11 am on November 9. To enter a raffle, you should participate in one of the above activities; place a pin on the map (and provide a fun fact about this location) or find a virtual cache in the Geocache. Winners must be present to accept their prize. -->
